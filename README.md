# Colorterm
A library based on termcolor. It uses ANSI control/escape sequences to get colored text to your terminal. If the system doesnt have support for ANSI control/escape sequences (everything below Windows 10). The stream objects will all be initialized to empty strings. So the ANSI commands dont show up on your screen. If you are on a system that doesnt support it.
