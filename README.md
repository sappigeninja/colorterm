# Colorterm
A library based on termcolor. It uses ANSI control/escape sequences to get colored text to your terminal. If the system doesnt have support for ANSI control/escape sequences (everything below Windows 10). The stream objects will all be initialized to empty strings. So the ANSI commands dont show up on your screen you will just get the text printed without color. If you are on a system that doesnt support it.
